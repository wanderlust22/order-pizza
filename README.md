#### _Pizza ordering website, {11.8.19}_

#### By _**{Will Quanstrom}**_

## Description

_Pizza! Pizza! is a website where a user selects pizza size and toppings and based on that selection, is given a price for their order._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone from github_
* _Open in browser_
* _Choose size and toppings in selector menu_
* _Click submit_
* _Total price will display to the right as well as the order history_

_My specs for the project were as follows: — Create a pizza object with properties of (size, toppings)_
_Create a pizza constructor that creates a new pizza object from the user’s input_
_Build a prototype that will take in the properties of (size, toppings) and return a price_
_Display the total price -- Display the order history in an unordered list_

## Known Bugs

_No bug but form type cannot be used to select multiple options at one time._

## Support and contact details

## Technologies Used

_Javascript used for back end logic with a combination of JS and jQuery for front end logic. Front end styling done in CSS and Bootstrap_
